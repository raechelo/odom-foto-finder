# FOTO FINDER
was a comp given to challenge and solidify our use of semantic HTML, clean, organized and dry CSS, dry Javascript, persistng local storage, and our ability to recreate a UI and create a great UX. We were to cement our knowledge of iterating and filtering through material on the DOM and array prototypes, as well as understand the difference between the data model and DOM.

# WHAT I LEARNED
In addition to the specs of the comp, I learned how to use basic ES6 arrow functions and the variety of which event references come in. There are so many that can all a function and it was really useful knowing I have more options than just the few I had already known. I also think I honed my skills more with events and event targeting. I honed my skills with media queries, and while still not perfect, I think I improved from my previos projects. Finally, and I think the most important, from working with others, I learned how and what to console in dev tools. It's hard to think of speficially what I need to console.log in order to see where my issue lies or what could be causing this small bug. And working with others while just watching them console.log or them helping me console.log to get through the issue has been immensely helpful to me.

# WISH LIST / WHAT'S LEFT
I would have liked to complete Phase 3, which would have been the addition of a recent photos function and the funcitonality behind the "View favorites" button. I also would have liked to put a few small animations on click for the trash can and the heart. Fianlly, I would have liked to get the Favorite Photo function at less than ten lines. All my other functions were and I would have liked to achieve Exceptional on at least a couple portions of the comp.

# PROJECT WINS
I didn't use a single for loop! I was able to use the array prototype forEach, which, especially when used with an arrow function, make the code much dryer and shorter. I used only named functions and not a single locally scoped function. My use of ES6 syntax for the few arrow functions I do have was a big win for me! I like the way the code looks so much more. I was also really excited to get the Clear Gallery function working. I thought that from a user's perspective, they ideally won't know how to clear their storage, so short of clicking each trash can (and how monotonous would that be?) that the Clear Gallery button would just be nice. It wasn't hard and it actually helped while I was developing the functionality behind the rest of the page! If I needed a quick clear, boom!
